# Installation

- We uploaded a snapshot of the tool with required 3rd-party libraries in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3627640). Simply unzip the contents somewhere; we will refer to this location as `installation path`.
- For future updates, please check out the [homepage](https://github.com/shafiul/slemi) (advanced users only; not required for ICSE 2020 artifacts evaluation).

# Basic Usage

Please watch the 5-minute video demo from the [README.md](README.md) file before using the tool!

## Pre-processing and Analyzing

Here, we will pre-process some Simulink models as this is the first step before performing any actual EMI-based mutation. For convenience, we have provided a small corpus with some Simulink models.

- Copy the `reproduce/samplecorpus` directory somewhere in your filesystem, and set this path to two environment variables: `COVEXPEXPLORE` and `SLSFCORPUS`. Models from this corpus will be used for pre-processing and eventually generating mutants.
- **WARNING:** Environment variables must be changed before opening MATLAB. If MATLAB is already open before changing the environment variables, please restart MATLAB.
- Open MATLAB, navigate to the `installation path` and execute `covexp.covcollect()` in the MATLAB command-prompt.

Your output will look like:

```
>> covexp.covcollect()
BaseCovExp.BaseCovExp 2020-01-25 11:28:23,833 INFO     Calling BaseCovExp constructor
ExploreCovExp.generate_model_list 2020-01-25 11:28:23,938 INFO     Generating model list from THE_PATH_WHERE_YOU_COPIED_SAMPLE_CORPUS

For complete documentation please check out: 

- The [covcfg.m](https://github.com/shafiul/slemi/blob/master/covcfg.m) configuration file itself which is well-documented.
- The [+covexp/Readme.md](https://github.com/shafiul/slemi/tree/master/%2Bcovexp) file. 


Once the script completes, you'll see overview of the experiment and a boxplot in a GUI depicting availability of zombie blocks in the model.

## Generating Mutants

After running the pre-processing phase, execute `emi.go` in the MATLAB command prompt to generate some mutants!

For complete documentation please check out:

- The [+emi/cfg.m](https://github.com/shafiul/slemi/blob/master/%2Bemi/cfg.m) configuration file itself which is well documented.
- The [+emi/Readme.md](https://github.com/shafiul/slemi/tree/master/%2Bemi) file .

### Reports

- Upon completion, each of the commands introduced above will present an overview of the experiment (e.g., result of differential testing). You can also manually run `covexp.addpaths(); emi.report()` in the MATLAB command-prompt to get detailed report.

- Where are my mutants? They are saved in the `emi_results` directory, go ahead and open a generated mutant in MATLAB! Mutants have `seedmodel_1_1` suffix (the numbers after the underscore are some unique identifiers). You can also open the seed model from the `sample corpus` to inspect manually.
