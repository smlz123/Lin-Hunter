classdef ExtraBlock < emi.livedecs.Decorator
    % Appends a new block for each "source blocks" in the `inp` cell
    % For concrete example see emi.livedecs.ExtraUnaryMinus
    % obj.hobj.inps contains "source blocks" and (out) ports. Add a new
    % block in the model, then connect from inp -> new block.
    % `inps` is a cell of cell. Outer dimension is for supporing parallel
    % operation. The inner cell is RX2 where R is the number of "source"
    % blocks. This is essential when the newly added block has multiple (R)
    % input ports -- so that none is left unconnected. It's up to you which
    % sources would connect to the newly added block.
